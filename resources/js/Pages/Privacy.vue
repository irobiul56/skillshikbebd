                your IP address, we manage

                locate
                and compile extensive demographic data. Finally, we can defend you from partnerships and fraud using
                your IP
                address. We will increase security as new technology becomes available. If we recoup or join forces with
                another company, you will send us information about yourself. In this situation, you will be informed by
                email or by posting clear warnings on the website prior to the transfer of the information and receipt
                of
                various privacy rules. If we believe it is essential to comply with the law, prevent impending physical
                harm
                or financial loss, or comply with court orders or similar legal processes, we may disclose your personal

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>


            <p class="mb-5 text-justify">Furthermore, you acknowledge that this website can contain information that is
                private to us and that you
                are not permitted to share it without our prior written consent. Even if the relevant authorities are
                legally obligated to share your information, it won't be done. Your information is treated as private.
                Your
                email information won't be given to a third party, sold, shared, or rented to us, and we won't spam you
                with
                emails either. We only discuss the services and goods we have agreed upon in the emails we send.</p>


            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

            <p class="mb-5 text-justify">We cannot guarantee that there will be no other possibility of disclosing your
                personal communications and
                other information as mentioned otherwise in this Privacy Policy due to the current regulatory
                environment.
                For instance, we might be compelled to provide information to the government, law enforcement, or other
                parties (without limiting or forgoing it). In some cases, members may abuse or misuse the data they
                gather
                from our website, or third parties may illegally intercept or access transmissions or private
                communications. Therefore, even while we use industry-standard practices to protect your privacy, we
                cannot
                and should not assume that your personal information, identifiable information, or private
                communications
                will always remain private. Our company policy prohibits us from renting or selling any information
                about
                you to a third party. However, the following outlines specific ways in which you can divulge your
                personal
                data: External service providers: Our websites work with a number of services provided by outside
                vendors.
                Their privacy policy will be applicable when you use these optional services and they need to gather
                data
                from you. Other corporate entities include: Your personal information is shared with our parent company
                and/or subsidiaries so they can assist you with your online needs and provide you with ancillary
                services
                that are offered globally. You will receive these details only to enhance your browsing experience and
                to
                offer our services. As long as they have access to your information, they will treat it similarly to how
                they treat the information of their other members. The company, one or more of its subsidiaries, or all
                of
                them, may be bought out by or combined with another company. If the package of services you requested
                was
                not something we could provide on our own servers, we might disclose part or all of your personal
                information. In the case that this occurs, you will be informed (to the extent that it occurs). To
                ensure
                the enforcement of numerous laws, including those pertaining to intellectual property, fraud, and other
                property rights, we collaborate with a number of other organizations, including law enforcement. You
                agree
                that in the event of an investigation into fraud, intellectual property infringement, or other criminal
                acts
                that could subject us or you to legal liability, we may disclose any personal information to law
                enforcement
                and government officials.</p>


            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">ACCESSING AND REVIEWING INFORMATION</h2>


            <p class="mb-5 text-justify">Every time you register, you can access and modify the data you provide. We can
                examine your past data to
                see if there have been any alterations. Your personal information, like your address, postcode, nation,
                and
                phone number, are all editable. In some circumstances, such as when it would be necessary to have a copy
                of
                the information to resolve disputes, or issues, or to comply with our terms and conditions, we may keep
                copies of the information you ask us to delete. Another concern is that because of technical and legal
                limitations, including storage backups, obsolete data has never been totally erased from our system. You
                shouldn't anticipate us completely deleting all of your personally identifiable data from our database
                in
                order to comply with your request.</p>


            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTORS</h2>


            <p class="mb-5 text-justify">Unless otherwise specified in our privacy policy, the information in this
                document only pertains to the way
                we collect and use your data. No matter where you discover them online, parties other than us may have
                different policies on how to use or disclose the information you give them. Regarding our use of them,
                third-party advertising has its own privacy policies. As we have no control over third parties' privacy
                rules, you should exercise caution before disclosing any personal information to anyone.</p>


            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">SECURITY</h2>


            <p class="mb-5 text-justify">We consider data to be a valuable asset, so we must take all reasonable
                precautions to prevent data loss and
                security breaches. We use a number of different security measures to protect the information from
                unauthorized access by people inside and outside the firm. We do not recommend that you share your
                banking
                or credit card information with other users on this website. It is advised that people conduct this
                offline,
                over the phone, or through private email. We follow accepted industry standards to protect the
                confidentiality of our customers' personal information throughout transit and after delivery. Online
                "perfect security" is not possible, but. Additionally, you agree that you are responsible for any
                security
                lapses that occur outside of our standard security practices.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">DISCLAIMER</h2>


            <p class="mb-5 text-justify">You should be aware that, due to the possibility of disclosure in ways not
                covered by this privacy
                statement, we are unable to guarantee the privacy of your private messages or other personal
                information,
                including your sensitive data like credit card and bank account details. Because of this, even while we
                pledge to preserve your privacy, we cannot make any absolute promises. As a user of this website, you
                understand and agree that you bear full responsibility and risk for all actions taken anywhere,
                including on
                this website, the Internet, your personal devices, and elsewhere.</p>


            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Disputes and jurisdiction</h2>


            <p class="mb-5 text-justify">A two-step alternative dispute resolution procedure will be used to settle all
                claims raised by this policy,
                including but not limited to claims about rights, refunds, and compensation. The first stage: is
                mediation.
                If a disagreement emerges, a neutral third party will be selected to resolve it, and each party will
                choose
                a mediator based on mutual consent. If both parties accept the single arbitrator proposed by either
                party,
                that individual will be tasked with mediating the dispute. However, the corporation has the right to
                make
                the final choice if the two suggested mediators are unable to come to an agreement. Despite the fact
                that
                the mediator's judgment is not legally enforceable, both parties will make every effort to comply with
                it.
                The arbitration process is the second stage. The arbitration award is final and enforceable by both
                parties
                if the mediation is unsuccessful. One arbitrator will be chosen by each party, and the third will be
                chosen
                by two more arbitrators who have agreed to work together. Bangladesh's capital city of Dhaka is the site
                of
                the arbitration. The language of the arbitration will be English. Both parties are required to abide by
                the
                arbitrator's ruling once it is rendered.</p>
